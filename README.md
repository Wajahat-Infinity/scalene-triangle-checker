## Scalene Triangle Checker

This Python script checks if a triangle is scalene based on its side lengths. It was created as a testing subject assignment.

**What is a Scalene Triangle?**

A scalene triangle is a triangle where all three sides have different lengths and all three angles have different measures. However, the sum of all the interior angles will always be 180 degrees, fulfilling the angle sum property of a triangle.

**How to Use the Script**

1. **Save the script:** Download or copy the code and save it as a Python file named `scalene_triangle.py`.
2. **Run the script:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Then, run the following command:

```
python scalene_triangle.py
```

3. **Enter side lengths:** The script will prompt you to enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. Enter valid numbers (decimals are allowed) for each side and press Enter.
4. **View the result:** The script will analyze the sides and determine if the triangle is scalene. It will display a message indicating whether the triangle is scalene or not.

**Example Usage**

```
Enter the length of the first side: 5
Enter the length of the second side: 7
Enter the length of the third side: 8
The triangle is scalene.
```

**Note:**

* The script assumes the entered values are valid numbers. If you enter non-numeric characters, the script will display an error message and exit.

**Further Exploration**

This script provides a basic check for scalene triangles. You can extend it to:

* Calculate the angles of the triangle (if side lengths are sufficient).
* Check for other triangle types (equilateral, isosceles).
* Handle potential errors in user input more gracefully.
